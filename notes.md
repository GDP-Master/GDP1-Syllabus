## Game Design as a Game

Ideas from Paul Anderson's TEDx Talk [Classroom Game Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qlYGX0H6Ec).

Make class a video game - allow students to work ahead (how to require collaboration - maybe require teams on certian projects and only release the project spec once a team has been constituted) as they acheive mastery. Maybe also allow different paths through the course.

Have one route preplanned along with pacing aimed at slower students. Present lessons at beginning of class "on pace." Students who are ahead may skip or attend as a refresher.

Have students "level up" through the class.

Have a leader board. Arrange the leader board so that you can see who has specific expertise (leader can move up if they can help with a question - move someone up in an area where they lead; likewise they can move down if they are unable to help with a question below their level af mastery). Allow students to become mentors for other students and when their mentees move up on the leader board the mentor also moves up. Use team progress on the leader board.
