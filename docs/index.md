# Game Design & Programming I

Game Design & Programming I is a one semester introduction to computer programming through games. We will develop a basic understanding of programming by building a series of small prototypes using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. In addition to game programming we also learn modern software development practices including source code management using Git and GitHub, pair programming and particpating on a development team, iterative design, and project management.

## Course Objectives

* Iterative design skills
* Programming in C#
* Creating games in Unity
* Source code management using Git and GitHub

## Projects

Each unit in the class is built around a game prototype that teaches a game programming skill:

* Unit 1: Player Control
* Unit 2: Basic Gameplay
