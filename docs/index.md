# Game Design & Programming I
**South Kitsap High School: 2019-2020**

Instructor: Douglas Urner, urner@skschools.org, Room 202E

**Game Design & Programming I** is a one semester introduction to the art and science of designing and building games and other interactive experiences. We will develop a basic understanding of programming by building a series of small prototypes using the C# programming language and the Unity game engine. In addition to game programming we also learn modern software development practices including source code management using Git and GitHub, pair programming and particpating on a development team, iterative design, and project management.

### Essential Tasks

By the end of the semester you will be able to:

* Use an iterative design process to create simple **digital prototypes** to test ideas for player movement, mechanics, and audio & visual effects.
* Program simple Unity components (scripts) using the C# programming language.
* Manage the code for your prototypes using Git and GitHub.

### Projects

Each unit in the class is built around a game prototype that teaches a game programming skill:

* **Prototype 1: Player Control** - a third person driving simulator.
* **Prototype 2: Basic Gameplay** - a top down game.
* **Prototype 3: Sounds & Effects** - an infinite side scroller.

### Assessment
